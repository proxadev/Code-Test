## Code Test Requirement
This code test requires you to replicate a UI screenshot using Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Next.js. Additionally, you need to write a simple API endpoint that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on the user input.

The screenshot can be found in the ```screenshots``` directory.

## Setup
Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm install.

## Environment Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/request](http://localhost:3000/api/request). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/request.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
